<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>LOOT is a plugin load order optimiser for TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. It is designed to assist mod users in avoiding detrimental conflicts, by automatically calculating a load order that satisfies all plugin dependencies and maximises each plugin's impact on the user's game.

<p>LOOT also provides some load order error checking, including checks for requirements, incompatibilities and cyclic dependencies. In addition, it provides a large number of plugin-specific usage notes, bug warnings and Bash Tag suggestions for Wrye Bash.

<p>While LOOT is able to calculate correct load order positions for the vast majority of plugins using only their content, it cannot do so for all plugins. As such, LOOT provides a mechanism for supplying additional plugin metadata so that it may sort them correctly. An online <em>masterlist</em> is provided to supply metadata for many plugins that need it, while users can make their own metadata additions, which are saved in their <em>userlist</em>.

<p>LOOT is intended to make using mods easier, and mod users should still possess a working knowledge of mod load ordering. See <a href="https://github.com/loot/loot.github.io/wiki/Introduction-To-Load-Orders">Introduction To Load Orders</a> for an overview.


<h2 id="install">Installation &amp; Uninstallation</h2>

<p><b>LOOT does not support Windows XP or earlier.</b>

<p>LOOT can be installed either using its automated installer or manually. To install LOOT manually, extract the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.

<p>If LOOT was installed using the installer, then use the uninstaller linked to in the Start Menu to uninstall LOOT. If LOOT was installed manually:
<ol>
    <li>Delete the files you extracted from the location you chose.
    <li>Delete the <q>LOOT</q> folder in your local application data folder, which can be accessed by entering <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%</code> into Windows' File Explorer.
</ol>


<h2 id="usage">Using LOOT</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="images/main.png">
    <figcaption>LOOT's user interface. The header bar is at the top, containing the main menu, game menu, masterlist update button and sorting button. On the left is the sidebar, which has the Plugins and Filters tabs, and the content filter at the bottom. On the right is the content area, which holds cards for summary information, general messages, and each installed plugin.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="usage-init">Initialisation</h3>

<p>When LOOT is run, it will attempt to detect which of the supported games are installed. If a <a href="#settingsDefaultGame">default game</a> has been set, LOOT will run for it, otherwise it will run for the same game as it last ran for. If the relevant game cannot be detected, or if there is no record of the last game LOOT ran for, it will run for the first detected game.

<p>LOOT can also be launched with the <code>LOOT.exe [--game=&lt;game folder name&gt;]</code> command line parameter to set the game to run for. If the supplied game folder name is valid, the default and last game values are ignored. The default folder names are <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Skyrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code> and <code>FalloutNV</code>.

<p>If LOOT cannot detect any supported game installs, it will immediately open the <a href="#usage-settings">Settings dialog</a>. There you can edit LOOT's settings to provide a path to a supported game, after which you can select it from the Game menu.

<p>Once a game has been set, LOOT will scan its plugins and load the game's masterlist, if one is present. The plugins and any metadata they have are then listed in their current load order.

<p>If LOOT detects that it is the first time you have run that version of LOOT, it will display a <q>First-Time Tips</q> dialog, which provides some information about the user interface that may not be immediately obvious.

<h3 id="usage-cards">Plugin Cards</h3>
<p>Each plugin is displayed on its own <q>card</q>. The front of the card displays information about the plugin, while the back of the card holds the plugin's metadata editor.

<p>LOOT uses a few icons on plugin cards to convey information about plugins:
<ul>
    <li><core-icon icon="check"></core-icon> is displayed if the plugin is active.
    <li><core-icon icon="visibility-off"></core-icon> is displayed if the plugin contains no data. Such plugins are generally used to load BSAs.
    <li><core-icon icon="attachment"></core-icon> is displayed if the plugin loads one or more BSAs. BSAs are special archives that contain resource files used by the game.
    <li><core-icon icon="account-circle"></core-icon> is displayed if the plugin has any user metadata.
</ul>

The <paper-icon-button icon="more-vert"></paper-icon-button> icon is a menu button. Clicking it displays the plugin's menu, which holds options for:
<ol>
    <li id="cardConflictFilter"><p>Toggling the plugin's conflict filter. This filters the plugin cards displayed so that only plugins which conflict with this plugin will be visible. If this plugin loads a BSA, other plugins that load BSAs which <em>may</em> contain conflicting resources are also displayed.</p>

    Only one plugin's conflict filter can be active at any one time, so activating a second conflict filter will deactivate the first. The plugin for which the filter is currently active is outlined in blue, like <span class="highlight">this text is</span>.
    <li>Editing the plugin's metadata. This flips the card over to show the editor controls.
    <li id="copyMetadata">Copying the plugin's metadata. The metadata is copied using the format that it is saved in, which makes it an easy way to share any edits you make with masterlist maintainers, for example. If posting the metadata in an online forum that supports BBCode (as most forums do), be sure to wrap it in <code>[code]</code> tags, eg. <code>[code]copied text[/code]</code>, so that the spaces are not removed by the forum software.
    <li>Clearing all user metadata from the plugin. This is irreversible, so LOOT will double-check that's what you want if you click on it.
</ol>

<p>The plugin filename is given in the card header beside the icons, along with the plugin's <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Check">CRC</abbr> value (if it has been calculated), and the plugin's version (if one has been found). LOOT looks for version numbers in plugins' description fields, so if a plugin supplies no version number, it cannot be displayed.

<p>If LOOT suggests any Bash Tags to be added, they will be displayed in <span style="color:green;">green text</span>, while any Bash Tags to be removed will be displayed in <span style="color:red;">red text</span>. Users generally don't need to do anything with this information, as if they're using Wrye Bash it will automatically apply LOOT's suggestions, and if they're not using Wrye Bash then this information doesn't apply.

<p>Below the card header and any Bash Tag suggestions, LOOT will display any messages it has for that plugin. LOOT's plugin messages are a valuable resource, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action.

<p>If you think a message suggests an unnecessary action, report it to an official LOOT thread. If you encounter a message that is non-conditional, ie. it suggests an action but is still displayed on subsequent runs of LOOT after the action has been carried out, also report it to an official LOOT thread, so that it can be made conditional.

<h3 id="usage-header">The Header Bar</h3>

<p>The header bar provides access to LOOT's main features. Most of these features get disabled while there is at least one plugin editor open, so if you're trying to use an option that has been <span class="disabled">greyed out</span>, first close any editors you have open.

<p>The main menu is accessed by clicking on the <paper-icon-button icon="menu"></paper-icon-button> button. It contains the following items:
<ol>
    <li><q>Redate Plugins</q> is provided so that Skyrim modders may set the load order for the Creation Kit. It is only enabled for Skyrim, and changes the timestamps of the plugins in its Data folder to match their current load order. A side effect of changing the timestamps is that any Steam Workshop mods installed will be re-downloaded.
    <li><q>Clear All User Metadata</q> removes all user-added metadata from all plugins. If this is clicked, LOOT will first request confirmation before removing any data, as the process is irreversible.
    <li><q>Copy Content</q> copies the data displayed in LOOT's cards as raw YAML data, which emphasises completeness over readability.
    <li><q>Refresh Content</q> re-scans the installed plugins' headers and regenerates the content LOOT displays. This can be useful if you have made changes to your installed plugins while LOOT was open, as it is faster than closing and re-opening LOOT.
    <li><q>Settings</q> opens up LOOT's settings dialog.
    <li><q>View Documentation</q> opens this readme file in your default web browser.
    <li><q>Open Debug Log Location</q> opens the folder in which LOOT stores its debug logs and other data, which can be useful when troubleshooting.
    <li><q>About</q> displays LOOT's about dialog.
</ol>

<p>Next to the main menu button is the drawer button, <paper-icon-button icon="drawer"></paper-icon-button>. This is only displayed when LOOT's window is sufficiently narrow that the sidebar is displayed as a slide-out drawer, and is used to toggle the drawer state.

<p>To the right of the menu and drawer icons is the game menu. The current game's name is displayed, and clicking on it will reveal a drop-down menu where other games can be selected. Selecting a game will switch LOOT to run for that game. Games which cannot be detected as installed are disabled in the list.


<h4 id="usage-update">Masterlist Update &amp; Sorting</h4>

<p>LOOT's masterlists are metadata databases that LOOT uses to provide messages and help sort plugins. By default, LOOT uses a separate masterlist for each game, with each masterlist being hosted online and maintained by the LOOT team.

<p>Clicking the <paper-icon-button icon="file-download"></paper-icon-button> button updates LOOT's masterlist for the current game to the latest available revision. If the latest revision cannot be parsed (eg. due to typos), then LOOT will roll back until it finds a revision that works.

<p>Clicking the <paper-icon-button icon="sort"></paper-icon-button> button begins LOOT's sorting process. By <a href="#settingsUpdateMasterlist">default</a>, sorting first updates the masterlist. LOOT then sorts your plugins according to a combination of data from the plugins themselves, and any metadata they may have. If a cyclic interaction is detected (eg. A depends on B depends on A), then sorting will fail.

<p>Once sorting has calculated a new load order, the plugin cards are sorted into that order, and the <paper-icon-button icon="file-download"></paper-icon-button> and <paper-icon-button icon="sort"></paper-icon-button> buttons are replaced with <paper-button>Apply</paper-button> and <paper-button>Cancel</paper-button> buttons. If the <paper-button>Apply</paper-button> button is clicked, LOOT applies the load order. If the <paper-button>Cancel</paper-button> button is clicked, then the load order and any edits made are discarded.

<p>LOOT is able to sort plugins ghosted by Wrye Bash, and can extract Bash Tags and version numbers from plugin descriptions. Provided that they have the <code>Filter</code> Bash Tag present in their description, LOOT can recognise filter patches and so avoid displaying unnecessary error messages for any of their masters that may be missing.

<h3 id="usage-filters">Filters</h3>
<p>Clicking the <q>Filters</q> tab in the sidebar will replace the sidebar's plugin list with a list of filter toggles that can be applied to hide various combinations of plugins and other content. The available filter toggles are:
<ul>
    <li><i>Hide version numbers</i>: Hides the version numbers printed in blue next to those plugins that provide them.
    <li><i>Hide CRCs</i>: Hides the CRCs printed in orange next to those plugins that provide them.
    <li><i>Hide Bash Tags</i>: Hides all Bash Tag suggestions.
    <li><i>Hide notes</i>: Hides all plugin messages that have the <i>Note:</i> prefix.
    <li><i>Hide 'Do not clean' messages</i>: Hides any messages that contain the string <q>Do not clean.</q>.
    <li><i>Hide all plugin messages</i>: Hides all plugin messages.
    <li><i>Hide inactive plugins</i>: Hides all plugins that are inactive.
    <li><i>Hide messageless plugins</i>: Hides any plugins that have no visible messages.
</ul>
<p>There are also two other filters:
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="cardConflictFilter">conflict filter</a> that can be accessed through each plugin's menu.
    <li>A content filter, located at the bottom of the sidebar. This hides any plugins that don't have the filter input value present in any of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Filename
        <li>Version
        <li>CRC value
        <li>Bash Tag suggestions
        <li>Messages
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="usage-custom">Editing Plugin Metadata</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="images/editor.png">
    <figcaption>A metadata editor panel.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>LOOT uses metadata to supply plugins with messages and Bash Tag suggestions, and to help it sort plugins that it otherwise can't sort correctly. Users can add to their plugins' metadata through each plugin's metadata editor panel, and plugins with user metadata are labelled with a <core-icon icon="account-circle"></core-icon> icon.
<p>A plugin's editor panel is accessed by clicking the <q>Edit Metadata</q> item in the plugin's menu. Multiple plugins can have their editor panels open at once, but everything in LOOT's menu bar is disabled while there is at least one panel open.

<p>Table rows that are for masterlist metadata cannot be edited or deleted. User metadata rows can be deleted by clicking their <core-icon icon="delete"></core-icon> icon.
<p>Rows can be added to the <q>Requirements</q>, <q>Incompatibilities</q> and <q>Load After</q> tables by dragging and dropping plugins from the sidebar into the table area.

<p>The <q>Apply</q> button will save any changes made, then exit the editor panel. The <q>Cancel</q> button will exit the editor panel without saving any changes.
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Control<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Enable User Changes<td>If this is checked, LOOT will use the metadata you supplied. Otherwise, your metadata will be ignored.
        <tr><td id="editingPriority">Priority<td>Modifies plugin position relative to others. Plugins with higher priority values load after plugins with lower priority values. Plugins have a default priority of 0. Plugin priorities are only compared if:
        <ul>
            <li>The two plugins conflict with each other.
            <li>One or both of the plugins is a "dummy" plugin, containing only a header record.
            <li>One or both of the plugins has a global priority.
        </ul>
        <tr><td>Requirements<td>This is a list of files that are required by the current plugin for it to function correctly. The current plugin will be loaded after any plugins listed. LOOT will also display an error message if any of the listed files are missing. Any file, not just plugins, can be listed here, and each entry has three fields:
        <ul>
            <li>The <var>filename</var> is the path, relative to the game's Data folder, of the file to be checked for. This field is required.
            <li>The <var>display name</var> is optional, and if specified will be used instead of the <var>filename</var> in any error messages that are displayed if a problem is encountered relating to the file.
            <li>The <var>condition</var> is the optional condition string that is used to determine if the file should be checked for. If left blank, the file will always be checked for. Condition strings are a relatively advanced part of LOOT's functionality, and their syntax is covered in the <a href="LOOT%20Metadata%20Syntax.html">Metadata Syntax</a> documentation.
        </ul>
        <p>Note that listing a plugin's masters as requirements is unnecessary, as LOOT already checks them.
        <tr><td>Incompatibilities<td>This is a list of files that are incompatible with the plugin. LOOT will display an error message if any of the listed files are found. Any file, not just plugins, can be listed here, and each entry has the same three fields as for the requirements table.
        <tr><td>Load After<td>This is a list of plugins which, if present, the current plugin must load after, but which are not required. This metadata can be used for resolving specific compatibility issues. Each entry has the same three fields as for the requirements table.
        <tr><td>Messages<td>A list of messages that are to be displayed for the plugin in LOOT's report. These have no bearing on a plugin's position in the load order.
        <p>Each message has four fields:
        <ul>
            <li>The <var>type</var> is fairly self-explanatory, and is used to provide messages of varying severity with appropriate emphasis in LOOT's report.
            <li>The <var>content</var> is the actual message text.
            <li>The <var>condition</var> is, like for the corresponding file field, used to determine if the message should be displayed. If left blank, the message is displayed.
            <li>The <var>language</var> is the language LOOT runs in that the message will be displayed for. This field has no effect for user-added messages, as they cannot contain multiple localisations, and LOOT will always display messages that have only one localisation, even if it doesn't match the current language.
        </ul>
        <p>If a message's condition determines that it should not be displayed, then it will not be displayed, no matter the language. However, if a message's condition determines that it should be displayed, but the language is specified and doesn't match the language LOOT is running in, the message will not be displayed.
        <tr><td>Bash Tags<td>A list of Bash Tags. These are used by Wrye Bash when generating a Bashed Patch. LOOT's metadata includes Bash Tag addition and removal suggestions, and any Bash Tags that came with the plugin are also displayed.
        <p>As LOOT can suggest Bash Tags be added or removed, it is possible for the same Tag to appear twice, being suggested for addition and removal. In such cases, removal overrides addition.
        <p>Each Bash Tag has three sub-fields:
        <ul>
            <li>The <var>state</var> determines whether the Tag is to be suggested for addition or removal.
            <li>The <var>name</var> is the actual Bash Tag name.
            <li>The <var>condition</var> decides if the Tag is to be suggested or not. It functions as for files and messages.
        </ul>
        <p>If a plugin's masters are missing, an error message will be displayed for it. Filter patches are special mods designed for use with a Bashed Patch that do not require all their masters to be present, and so any plugin with the <code>Filter</code> tag applied and missing masters will not cause any errors to be displayed.

<h3 id="usage-settings">Editing Settings</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="images/settings.png">
    <figcaption>LOOT's settings dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>LOOT's settings may be accessed by clicking <q>Settings</q> button in LOOT's menu bar. The settings are detailed in the table below.
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Setting<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td id="settingsDefaultGame">Default Game<td>If set to something other than <q>Autodetect</q>, this overrides game autodetection. If the game specified is not detected, LOOT falls back to autodetection.
        <tr><td>Language<td>Controls the language LOOT uses in its interfaces. Any plugin messages that do not have translations in the selected language will be displayed in English, if available, or in their available language otherwise.
        <tr><td>Enable Debug Logging<td>If enabled, writes debug output to <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\LOOT\LOOTDebugLog.txt</code>. Debug logging can have a noticeable impact on performance, so it is off by default.
        <tr><td id="settingsUpdateMasterlist">Update masterlist before sorting<td>If checked, LOOT will update its masterlist, should an update be available, before sorting plugins.
</table>
<p>LOOT's game-specific settings can be customised in the games table. Settings can also be added for additional game instances, making it easy to use LOOT across multiple copies of a game, including total conversion mods. LOOT ships with settings for the <q>Nehrim - At Fate's Edge</q> total conversion mod as an example.
<p>The games instances defined in this table are displayed in LOOT's <q>Game</q> menu, and can be selected there if detected. Game instance settings may be deleted by clicking the <core-icon icon="delete"></core-icon> icon at the end of the game's row. The current game cannot have its settings deleted. If you delete the settings for one of LOOT's core four supported games (Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas), they will be recreated when LOOT is next run.
<p>The game settings are explained in the table below.
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Game Setting<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Name<td>The name of the game, or another identifying string, that is displayed in menus and the LOOT's title bar.
        <tr><td>Base Game Type<td>Every game LOOT runs for must use the plugin file format and load order system of one of the following games:
        <ul>
            <li>TES IV: Oblivion
            <li>TES V: Skyrim

            <li>Fallout: New Vegas
        </ul>
        <tr><td>LOOT Folder Name<td>The sub-folder which LOOT uses to store the game's files in. Each game must be given a unique sub-folder.
        <tr><td>Master File<td>The game's main master file. This is specified as it must load before all other plugins. Note that Skyrim-based games will always load Skyrim.esm first, so this column must always be set to <q>Skyrim.esm</q> for such games.
        <tr><td id="settingsMasterlistURL">Masterlist Repository URL<td>The URL of the repository that LOOT uses to update its local copy of the masterlist. If set to an empty string, masterlist updating will be skipped.

        Masterlist repositories are <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repositories that are configured to allow unauthenticated read access and contain a masterlist file named <code>masterlist.yaml</code> in their root directory. The LOOT team maintains a set of official repositories for the games that LOOT supports by default.
        <tr><td>Masterlist Repository Branch<td>The branch of the masterlist repository that LOOT should get masterlist updates from.
        <tr><td>Install Path<td>The path to the game's folder, in which the Data folder lies. Either this or a registry key must be supplied.
        <tr><td>Install Path Registry Key<td>The registry key, in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code>, that contains the install path of the game. This is used to obtain the install path if LOOT has no previous record of the game's install path, or LOOT's stored install path is invalid. Either this or an install path must be supplied.

<h2 id="contrib">Contributing &amp; Support</h2>
<p>LOOT is very much a community project, and contributions from its users are vital to its upkeep, whether they be metadata, translations, code or anything else. The best way to contribute is to <a href="https://github.com/loot/loot.github.io/wiki/How-To-Contribute">make changes yourself</a> at GitHub! It's the fastest way to get changes you want applied, and you'll get your name automatically immortalised in our <a href="http://loot.github.io/credits/">credits</a>.

<p>If you encounter an issue with LOOT, check the <a href="https://github.com/loot/loot.github.io/wiki/LOOT-FAQs">Frequently Asked Questions</a> wiki page in case a solution is available there.

<p>Otherwise, general discussion and support takes place in LOOT's official forum threads. These are linked to at the bottom of <a href="http://loot.github.io">LOOT's homepage</a>.

<p>If you want to submit metadata, the easiest way to do so is to add the metadata to your own LOOT install, then use the <a href="#copyMetadata">Copy Metadata</a> feature to easily get it in a form that you can then edit into a masterlist on GitHub or post in the official forum threads.

<p>Information on dirty plugins is very welcome, but for such information to be useful we require at least the filename and the CRC of the dirty plugin. The CRC may be calculated using Wrye Bash or 7-Zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-Zip, the <q><em>CRC checksum for data</em></q> is the one required. In addition to the CRC, the number of records removed (the ITM count) and/or undeleted (the UDR count) are also welcome.

<p>While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of LOOT, the LOOT Team encourages those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endeavour with the Team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently is already planned for a future version of LOOT or would be happily integrated into LOOT, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.

<p>LOOT has been specifically designed to prevent it being locked into the LOOT Team's official masterlist repositories. Nevertheless, the LOOT Team appeals to the community to avoid the distribution of unofficial masterlists, as this would only hamper the effort to create one set of stores for load order information. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the LOOT Team so that they may be remedied.

<h3>0.7.0 - <i>X Y 2014</i></h3>
<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The default registry key for Nehrim was wrong.
    <li>Messages were displayed in the wrong language if LOOT's language was not English.
    <li>Cyclic interaction errors listed plugins not involved in the cycle.
    <li>Bash Tags suggestions were not displayed correctly.
    <li>The API crashed when writing a minimal list to a location that doesn't exist.
    <li>Inactive incompatibilities were displayed as error messages. They are now displayed as warnings.
    <li>Masterlist updating failed when a fast-forward merge was not possible (eg. when remote has been rebased, or a different repository is used). Such cases are now handled by deleting the local repository and re-cloning the remote.
    <li>The <code>settings.yaml</code> included with the installer was very old.
    <li>LOOT forgot plugin CRCs and active status if the settings dialog was opened and exited using the <q>OK</q> button, leading to conditional messages being wrongly displayed or hidden.
    <li>LOOT crashed when trying to read corrupt plugins.
    <li>Masterlist entries that matched the same plugin were not being merged. Now one exact match and any number of regex matches will be merged.
    <li>Masterlists would not 'update' to older revisions. This can be useful for testing, so now they can do so.
    <li>Permissions errors would occur when deleting local masterlist repositories.
    <li>A crash could occur after masterlist update completed.
    <li>Plugins with non-ASCII description text would cause <code>codecvt to wstring</code> errors.
    <li>LOOT would accept any file with a <code>.esp</code> or <code>.esm</code> extension as a plugin. It now checks more thoroughly, by attempting to parse such files' headers.
    <li>LOOT would only detect Skyrim plugins as loading BSAs. Plugins for the other games that also load BSAs are now correctly detected as such.
</ul>
<h4>Additions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>German translation.
    <li>Support for GitHub Flavored Markdown in masterlist messages, minus features specific to the GitHub site, such as @mentions and emoji.
    <li>If LOOT can't detect any installed games, it now launches to the settings dialog, where the game settings can be edited to allow a game to be detected.
    <li><q>Copy Content As Text</q> menu item to copy the plugin list and all information it contains to the clipboard as YAML-formatted text.
    <li>A <q>Refresh Content</q> item has been added to the main menu, which re-scans plugin headers and updates LOOT's content.
    <li>LOOT is now built as with the Large Address Aware flag.
    <li>Masterlist update can now be performed separately from sorting.
    <li>A <q>First-Time Tips</q> dialog will be displayed on the first run of any particular version of LOOT.
    <li>If LOOT is closed before a sorted load order is applied, it will first ask if the sorted order should be applied or discarded.
    <li>High DPI display support.
    <li>Support for message content substitution metadata syntax in the masterlist.
    <li>Display of LOOT's build revision has been added to the <q>About</q> dialog.
    <li>Plugin location metadata can now be added through the user interface.
    <li>A content filter has been added, which hides plugins that don't have the filter string present in their filenames, versions, CRCs, Bash Tags or messages.
</ul>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>New single-window HTML5-based interface, using elements of Google's Material Design.
    <ul>
        <li>wxWidgets has been replaced with the Chromium Embedded Framework.
        <li>LOOT now parses the masterlist and plugin headers on startup, and the resulting content is displayed with the plugins in their current load order.
        <li>A sidebar containing a list of plugin sections, the filters and a search box has been added.
        <li>Icons have been added to show if plugins are active, contain no records, load BSAs and/or have user metadata. The latter three are displayed on each plugin's card and in the sidebar, while the first is only displayed on each plugin's card.
        <li>A menu has been added to the top-right of each plugin's card, through which plugin-specific functionality can be accessed.
        <li>Metadata editing controls are now accessed through each plugin's menu. Each plugin now has its own editor, displayed on the reverse of its card. Multiple editors can be opened at once. Any operations performed through the menu bar (eg. sorting, game changing) are disabled while there is an editor open.
        <li>Plugin priorities can be viewed by hovering over their names in the sidebar while an editor is open.
        <li>Drag 'n' drop of plugins from the sidebar into metadata editor tables no longer requires the conflicts filter to be enabled.
        <li>CRCs are calculated and records are counted during conflict filtering or sorting, so CRCs and dummy plugin icons are not displayed until either process has been performed.
        <li>The <q>Remove All User-Added Metadata</q> menu item has been renamed to <q>Clear All User Metadata</q> and moved into the main menu.
        <li>The <q>Remove Plugin User-Added Metadata</q> menu item has been renamed to <q>Clear User Metadata</q> and moved into the plugin menu.
        <li>The <q>Show only conflicting plugins</q> filter has been renamed to <q>Show Only Conflicts</q> and moved into the plugin menu.
    </ul>
    <li>The <q>View Debug Log</q> menu item has been replaced with a <q>Open Debug Log Location</q> menu item to make it easier to upload the file itself.
    <li>Debug logging control has been simplified to enable/disable, replacing the <q>Debug Verbosity</q> setting with an <q>Enable Debug Logging</q> checkbox.
    <li>Changes to game settings now take immediate effect.
    <li>Masterlist updating now exits earlier if the masterlist is already up-to-date.
    <li>Masterlist revisions are now displayed using the shortest unique substring that is at least 7 characters long.
    <li>Making edits to plugin metadata before applying a calculated load order no longer causes LOOT to recalculate the load order. Instead, the displayed load order is applied, and the metadata edits will be applied the next time sorting is performed.
    <li>Updated dependencies: Boost (v1.57.0), libespm (latest), libloadorder (v6.0.1),  yaml-cpp (latest).
    <li>LOOT's calculated load orders are now more intuitive: an additional constraint was added so that plugins will be placed in alphabetical order so long as doing so does not violate any of the other constraints.
    <li>All references to <q>UDRs</q> have been replaced by the more technically-correct <q>Deleted References</q> term.
    <li>The <q>Hide inactive plugin messages</q> filter has been replaced by a <q>Hide inactive plugins</q> filter.
</ul>
<h4>Removals</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Messages with multiple language strings can no longer be created through the user interface. User-added multiple-language messages will be converted to single-language strings if their plugin's editor is opened then closed using the <q>OK</q> button.
    <li>The <q>Copy Name</q> menu item has been removed, as plugin names can now be selected and copied using <code>Ctrl-C</code>.
    <li>As LOOT no longer generates reports, it doesn't save them either.
</ul>
<h4>API</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed some documentation errors.
    <li>Fixed the API creating a LOOT folder when being initialised.
    <li>Fixed false successes for <code>loot_create_db()</code> when invalid paths were supplied.
    <li>Fixed <code>loot_load_lists()</code> ignoring userlist paths, and accepting invalid paths.
    <li>Fixed <code>loot_eval_lists()</code> accepting invalid language codes.
    <li>Fixed <code>loot_get_dirty_info()</code> never outputting the <code>loot_needs_cleaning_no</code> code.
    <li>Added load order sorting and application functions.
    <li>Added masterlist update and revision checking functions.
    <li>Added support for native Linux builds.
    <li>Added unit testing of API functions to help ensure correctness and consistency of functionality.
    <li>Added <code>loot_get_build_id()</code>, which outputs the shortened revision ID that the API was built from.
    <li>API updates are now released alongside application updates, in a separate archive. The archive contains the documentation in PDF format, the API's header file, and a 32-bit DLL.
</ul>

<h3>0.6.0 - <i>05 July 2014</i></h3>
<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The uninstaller not removing the Git repositories used to update the masterlists.
    <li>Miscellaneous crashes due to uncaught exceptions.
    <li>Plugin priorities are now temporarily "inherited" during sorting so that a plugin with a low priority that is made via metadata to load after a plugin with a high priority doesn't cause other plugins with lower priorities to be positioned incorrectly.
    <li>The default language is now correctly set to English.
    <li>Defaults for the online masterlist repository used for Nehrim.
    <li>Endless sorting loop that occurred if some user metadata was disabled.
</ul>
<h4>Additions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Display of masterlist revision date in reports.
    <li>Report filter for inactive plugin messages.
    <li>The number of dirty plugins, active plugins and plugins in total to the report summary.
    <li>A find dialog to the report viewer, initiated using the <code>Ctrl-F</code> keyboard shortcut.
    <li>LOOT's windows now remember their last position and size.
    <li>Command line parameter for selecting the game LOOT should run for.
    <li>Finnish translation.
</ul>
<h4>Removals</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Support for Windows XP.
    <li>Support for loading BOSS masterlists using the API. This was a leftover from when LOOT was BOSSv3 and backwards compatibility was an issue.
    <li>The ability to open reports in an external browser. This was necessitated by the changes to report generation.
    <li>The MSVC 2013 redistributable requirement.
    <li>The "None Specified" language option is no longer available: English is the new default.
</ul>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Unified and improved the metadata editors launched during and outside of sorting.
    <ul>
        <li>The metadata editor now resizes more appropriately.
        <li>The mid-sorting instance hides the requirement, incompatibility, Bash Tags, dirty info and message lists.
        <li>Both instances now have a conflict filter, priority display in their plugin list and drag 'n' drop from the plugin list into whatever metadata lists are visible.
        <li>The mid-sorting instance also hides the load after entry edit button, and the button to add new entries (so drag 'n' drop is the only available method of adding entries).
        <li>The metadata editor now displays plugins with user edits using a tick beside their name, rather than bolding their name text.
        <li>Plugins that have been edited in the current instance have their list entry text bolded.
        <li>Checkboxes have been added to set whether or not a priority value is "global". The UI also now displays the priority value used in comparisons (ie. with the millions and higher digits omitted).
        <li>A right-click menu command for clearing all user-added metadata for all plugins has been added to the metadata editor.
    </ul>
    <li>Missing master/requirement and incompatibility errors are downgraded to warnings if the plugin in question is inactive.
    <li>Masterlist update errors have been made more user-friendly.
    <li>If an error is encountered during masterlist update, LOOT will now silently delete the repository folder and attempt the update again. If it fails again, it will then report an error.
    <li>Masterlist update now handles repository interaction a lot more like Git itself does, so should be less error-prone.
    <li>Cyclic dependency error messages now detail the full cycle.
    <li>LOOT's report now uses a static HTML file and generates a javascript file that is dynamically loaded to contain the report data. This removes the PugiXML build dependency.
    <li>Debug log message priorities adjusted so that medium verbosity includes more useful data.
    <li>Updated dependencies: libgit2 (v0.21.0), wxWidgets (v3.0.1), libloadorder (latest), libespm (latest).
</ul>

<h3>0.5.0 - <i>31 March 2014</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Initial release.
</ul>
