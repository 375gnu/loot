<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>BOSS is a plugin load order optimiser for TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. It is designed to assist mod users in avoiding detrimental conflicts, by automatically calculating a load order that satisfies all plugin dependencies and maximises each plugin's impact on the user's game.

<p>BOSS also provides some load order error checking, including checks for requirements, incompatibilities and cyclic dependencies. In addition, it provides a large number of plugin-specific usage notes, bug wawrnings and Bash Tag suggestions.

<p>Although BOSS is able to calculate the correct load order positions for the vast majority of mods without any user input, some plugins are designed to load at certain positions in a load order, and BOSS may be unable to determine this from the plugins themselves. As such, BOSS provides a mechanism for supplying additional plugin metadata so that it may sort them correctly.

<p>BOSS is intended to make using mods easier, and mod users should still possess a working knowledge of mod load ordering. See <a href="#appendix-intro">Introduction To Load Orders</a> for an overview.


<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

<blockquote>BOSS version 3 is not backwards compatible with version 2, as it makes a variety of major changes to how BOSS works. In particular, it will almost certainly set a different load order, and any user rules will have to be manually recreated in BOSS's user interface.</blockquote>

<p>The simplest way to install BOSS is to use the installer. However, the instructions below are provided if a manual install method is preferred.
<ol>
    <li>If updating from an earlier version of BOSS, uninstall the existing BOSS install before continuing. Any userlists you have should be moved to a temporary location while you install the BOSS update.
    <li>Extract the <q>BOSS</q> folder the downloaded archive contains to a location of your choice. Make sure that you have the appropriate file permissions for the directory you choose. See the <a href="#appendix-permissions">File Permissions</a> section for more information.
    <li>If any of the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities are installed, make sure their <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting is enabled.
    <li>If updating from an earlier version of BOSS and you moved any userlists you have to a temporary location, after you have run BOSS at least once for each game with a userlist, you will need to move your userlist(s) into the game(s) subfolders that are created within the BOSS folder.
</ol>
<p>If BOSS was installed using the installer, then use the uninstaller it provides a link to in the Start Menu to uninstall BOSS. If BOSS was installed manually, simply delete the <q>BOSS</q> folder you installed.


<h2 id="usage">Using BOSS</h2>
<p>When BOSS is run, it will attempt to detect which of the supported games are installed, and set itself to run for the first game detected, unless a <a href="#settingsDefaultGame">default game</a> has been set, in which case it will set itself to run for that game. Once a game has been set, the main window will be displayed.
<figure>
    <img alt="BOSS's main window" src="images/main.png">
    <figcaption>BOSS's main window. The title bar displays which game BOSS is running for.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clicking the <q>Edit Metadata</q> button will open BOSS's metadata editor, where you can make changes to the metadata BOSS uses to sort plugins, the messages that get displayed for plugins, and any Bash Tag suggestions BOSS makes. BOSS also gives you the opportunity to make any such changes when it sorts your plugins, but this option is useful for when you don't want to go through the full sorting process. See <a href="#usage-custom">Customising BOSS's Results</a> for more information.
<p>Clicking the <q>Sort Plugins</q> button will begin the plugin sorting process. This will sort your plugins, allow you to make any changes, then display a report that details the results of BOSS's activity. See <a href="#usage-sort">Sorting Plugins</a> for more information.
<p>Clicking the <q>View Last Report</q> button will display the report generated the last time BOSS sorted your plugins.  See <a href="usage-log">The Results Report</a> for more information.
<p>The <q>File</q> menu provides menu items for sorting plugins, viewing the last report BOSS generated and quitting BOSS, while the <q>Edit</q> menu provides menu items for accessing BOSS's metadata editor and the <a href="usage-settings">settings window</a>.
<p>The <q>Active Game</q> menu allows you to change which game BOSS is running for without having to close and re-open it. Games that BOSS cannot find are greyed out, and the the one BOSS is running for is marked with a dot to its left. To change the active game, simply select another game in the list.
<p>The <q>Help</q> menu provides links to BOSS's documentation and an about page that contains the version of BOSS being run, some legal information and a link to the project repository.

<h2 id="trouble">Troubleshooting</h2>


<h2 id="contrib">Contributing To BOSS</h2>
<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to BOSS's metadata masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Please let us know what you know!

<p>General discussion and the submission of questions, suggestions and metadata takes place in BOSS's official threads for <a href="">Oblivion</a>, <a href="">Nehrim</a>, <a href="">Skyrim</a>, <a href="">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.

<p>Notifications of dirty plugins are very welcome, but for such information to be useful we require:
<ul>
    <li>The plugin filename.
    <li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/TES5Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
    <li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/TES5Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
    <li>The CRC of the dirty plugin. Make sure that the CRC is of the dirty file, not the file after cleaning. The CRC may be calculated using <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q><em>CRC checksum for data</em></q> is the one required.
</ul>

<p>While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of BOSS, the BOSS Development Team encourages those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endevour with the Team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently from BOSS itself is already planned for a future version of BOSS or would be happily integrated into BOSS by the Team, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.
<p>The BOSS Team also appeals to the community to avoid the distribution and development of alternative masterlists, as this would only hamper the community effort to create one universally-optimised load order for all plugins available for download. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the BOSS Team so that we may remedy them ourselves.

<h2 id="appendix">Appendices</h2>
<h3 id="appendix-intro">Introduction To Load Orders</h3>
<p>This appendix provides a general overview of load ordering in the games BOSS supports for those who are unfamiliar with the concept. For simplicity, <q>the game</q> will be used when the text refers to any of the games that BOSS supports.
<p>Mod plugins for the game are files that end in <code>.esp</code> or <code>.esm</code>. These files are created by the game's official editing tools, or by third party modders' tools. They contain various data entries, which can either be brand new additions or changes to the entries added by another plugin, including the game's main master file (Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Skyrim.esm, Fallout3.esm or FalloutNV.esm depending on the game). These entries cover almost all aspects of what is in the game, eg. NPCs, items, races, interiors, worlds, quests, etc.
<p>When the game is run, it loads each of the plugins you have installed one by one. The order in which it loads them is, unsurprisingly, what is referred to as the load order. The load order is important for two reasons:
<ul>
 <li>Dependency resolution.
 <li>Conflict resolution.
</ul>
<p>A plugin which changes the entries added by other plugins is dependent on those other plugins, and the game requires all of the latter plugins to be loaded before the former. If they aren't, the game will crash on launch.
<p>The game can only apply one version of any one entry (this is known as the <q>rule of one</q>). Therefore, when more than one plugin changes the same entry, the load order is used to decide which plugin's changes are applied. Put simply, the last loaded plugin's changes are applied. The one exception to the <q>rule of one</q> is that the contents of cells (the physical space in which your character moves) can be changed by any number of plugins, so different plugins can add objects to cells, move them around or remove them and all will see their changes applied by the game.
<p>By changing the load order, you can change which plugins override and which are overridden, and so reduce detrimental conflicts. You cannot actually reduce how much is overridden through load order alone, but it is often the case that some overrides are acceptable while others cause problems in game. Setting a good load order is the process by which you seek to maximise the former instead of the latter.
<p>Further compatibility between mods is then possible through the use of patches, which are made to address incompatibilities between specific mods, and through the use of Wrye Bash, which can create a <q>Bashed Patch</q> that allows you to select between types of changes for different mods. For example, two mods change a piece of armour, but one changes how it looks and the other changes its effectiveness: through load order alone you could only ever get one change, but using Wrye Bash you can get both, because they change different things in the same armour entry.
<p>There are a few hardcoded rules that trump load order in many cases:
<ul>
 <li>Master plugins always load before non-master plugins.
 <li>There is a limit of 255 active plugins that can be loaded by the game. This isn't strictly a load <em>order</em> thing, but is worth mentioning.
 <li>In Skyrim, <code>Skyrim.esm</code> always loads before all other plugins.
 <li>In Skyrim, if <code>Update.esm</code> is present, it is always loaded. If it has no load order position set, it loads after all other master plugins. That might sound a bit odd, but thanks to Skyrim's load order mechanism, it is possible for it to have no set load order position, even though it is always loaded.
</ul>
<p>A plugin's position in the load order is often displayed by mod managers as a hexadecimal number, from 00 to FE (0 to 255 in decimal). The plugin with position 00 loads first, and the plugin with position FE is loaded last. Hexadecimal numbers are used to display the load order positions of plugins because these numbers form the first two digits of the code that the game uses to reference the entries that the plugin adds, so knowing the numbers allows modders and mod users to determine from which plugin an entry is from.
<p>That's all that you as a mod user <em>need</em> to know about load orders. If you want to find out more about the actual mechanism by which the game decides the load order, read on.
<p>Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas all share the same mechanism for deciding load order. Skyrim, since the 1.4.26 patch, uses a different mechanism.
<p>Load order for Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas is decided by the modification date timestamps of the mod plugins. The active plugin with the earliest date loads first, with plugins being listed in descending date order (earliest to latest). It's a bad idea for a plugin that isn't the game's main master file to load first.
<p>Skyrim's mechanism uses the order that plugins are listed within its <code>plugins.txt</code> file as its load order (from top to bottom). This file is the one in which the list of active plugins is stored, so only active plugins can be strictly said to have a load order.

<h3 id="appendix-dirty">Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</h3>
<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are in a mod, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.
<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3), FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas) or TES5Edit (for Skyrim). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also largely applies to Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim). <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> can also scan plugins for dirty edits and return their ITM and UDR counts, though at the time of writing it cannot clean plugins itself.
<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems dirty mods can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as it holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:
<ul>
    <li><i><abbr title="Identical To Master">ITM</abbr> Count</i>: ITM records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
    <li><i><abbr title="Undeleted and Disabled Reference">UDR</abbr> Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDRs are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
    <li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.
</ul>
<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.
<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <a href="#contrib">Contributing To BOSS</a> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.
<p><b>Note:</b> TES4Edit et al. will include a variety of <em>junk records</em> in the ITM count for a plugin, such as new empty cells that are automatically generated by the Construction Set and are almost impossible to remove. These junk records are non-harmful, and BOSS will inform users when a mod contains these to avoid confusion. This is also the source of any discrepancies between the counts produced by TES4Edit and those produced by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>. The latter's counts are more technically accurate, but both are acceptable for use.
<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Identical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for plugins with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.

<h3 id="appendix-permissions">File Permissions</h3>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or a later version of Windows, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
    <li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.
    <li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
    <li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
    <li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
    <li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
    <li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
    <li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
    <li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
    <li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>
