LOOT's user interface has CSS theming support. A dark theme is provided with LOOT: to use it, rename ``dark-theme.css`` in the ``resources/ui/css`` folder to ``theme.css``. A working knowledge of CSS is required to create new themes, though the provided dark theme CSS file is commented to provide some assistance.
